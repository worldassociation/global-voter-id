# Global Voter ID App

The _Global Voter ID_ app is a free and open source platform that enables anyone to participate in global governance processes. By democratizing decision-making, we aim to ensure that governance aligns with the needs and values of humanity as a whole.

## How it Works:

1. **Proof of Personhood:** To participate, users complete a facial scanning process to verify that each voter is a real and unique human. This step guarantees the integrity of our democratic system by preventing fraud or duplicate identities.

2. **Voter ID Creation:** After successful verification, you receive a non-transferable (or "soulbound") ERC20 token as your Global Voter ID. This token cannot be transferred, ensuring your identity is securely tied to your participation.

3. **Use in Governance Platforms:** With your Voter ID, you can join democratic governance processes across various platforms. Whether it's participating in a space on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/), interacting with onchain governor contracts, or engaging with crypto quest platforms, your Global Voter ID gives you the power to vote on key proposals and decisions.

The _Global Voter ID_ system is designed to be universally accessible—free to use by individuals, projects, and organizations without any need for permission. It provides a powerful, decentralized tool for ensuring that global governance processes are inclusive, secure, and transparent.

## Philosophy

[World Association](https://www.worldassociation.org/) applications are built on the principles of openness, individual freedom, and the right to fork. All core software and tools needed to run these applications are freely available and easy to use. This ensures that if the World Association or any of its platforms is ever compromised, the community can fork the system and create a new version that better serves the collective interests of humanity.
